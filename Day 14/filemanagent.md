# File Management

In the previous module, you emphasized that a computer system processes and stores information. Usually, during processing computers need to frequently access primary memory for instructions and data. However, the primary memory can be used only for only temporary storage of information. This is so because the primary memory of a computer system is volatile. The volatility is evinced by the fact that when you switch off the power the information stored in the primary memory is lost. The secondary memory, on the other hand, is non-volatile. This means that once the user has finished his current activity on a computer and shut down his system, the information on disks (or any other form of secondary memory) is still available for a later access. The non-volatility of the memory enables the disks to store information indefinitely. Note that this information can also be made available online all the time. Users think of all such information as files.

As a matter of fact, while working on a computer system a user is continually engaged in managing or using his files in one way or another. OS provides support for such management through a file system. File system is the software which empowers users and applications to.. organize and manage their files. The organization and management of files may involve access, updates and several other file operations.
