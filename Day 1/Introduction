Operating Syctem concepts with Linux:
------------------------------------
1.Process and process management
2.File and file management
3.Memory and Memory Management
4.Signeal Handling
5.IPC Inter Process Communication
6.Process synchronization
7.Threads
8.Shell scripting


what is OS?
Os is a software with qualities of multitasking,managing resource effectively,resource allocation and resource managing.

Why Linux?
It will support  for around 20 architeecture and linux is free source code

Embedded oS/Embedded Linux

Os is a software that control the hardware.

                             OS
                --------------------------------
                |                               |
    Applications(optional)                Services(kernel)
                                        -process management
                                        -memory management
                                        -signal management
                                        -Network mangement
                                        -Thread management (compulsory)
                                       services are sometime drivers

What are the components of OS?
1)application
2)services
kernel is called CORE of an Operating System
Applications are optional services are mandatory



Booting process of Linux:

1.BIOS:Basic Input Output System
      present in ROM chip manufacture burns are program into ROM chip is called BIOS
      BIOS will check that before loading OS,it will check if basic Input/Output system like keyboard,harddisk,RAM etc..is present or not,then only proceed ahead otherwise not proceed.

2.If everything ok Then BIOS will run one program called MBR(Master Boot Record)(a file of 12 bytes)present inthe starting portion of harddisk(HDD).
  MBR:It is loaded at first sector of the bootable disk.MBR is less than 512 byte
      contains information about GRUB loader/loader
      every OS has individual loader
      linux lifo,windows nt,Here GRUB

3.WBR executes GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)
4.GRUB will load kernel
  Can be used for any OS
  Multiboot is the speciality
  Loads the preferd kernel image
  Displays option

5.Kernel Loads all the services
  (load some temporary file system mount the file system)
   Mount root files system
   Kernel executes the/sbin /init program
   In simple term as loaded into RAM

6.Its starts one service called Init
  started after all the manager in kernel has started
  first program starts in user space
  process id is alwways 1 since start in user space
  Init identifier the default initials from /etc/initial and uses that to load appropriate program

7.Run level program:
init process initiates all services .All the services(drivers)are loaded into the RAM.
