system calls vs library function
----------------------------------

library                                              system call
-------                                              -----------
.library funtions are compiler supported functions    .system calls are os supported functions
.(API)application programing                          .(SCI)system call interface
.most library functions on fail return 0              .most sys call return 1 on fail
.working procedure with API is called application     .working procedure with sci is called as system programing
  programing         .
.library functions are slower but process calling     .They are faster the process calling the system calls execute
  the library functions executes faster                 slower
.library functions are programmer friendly and        .systems calls are frindly and generic
  specific to task  
.library functions executes in usr space              .system calls executes in kernel space
.library functions can be debugged using debugger     .system calls cannot be debugged as executded by kernel space but you can check rerurn value and error number to avoid failure



for file operations data is read from file with help of system calls during the time only are goes into kernel space
since data in buffer each time it doesnt need to access kernel

Accesing kernel takes max time

with system calls each time it has to go to kernel space so process caling executes slower


man page of library function is 3(compilre supported)
man page of SCi is 2(OS supported).
