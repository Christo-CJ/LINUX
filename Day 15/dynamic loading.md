# Dynamic Loading

The entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute. The size of a process is thus limited to the size of physical memory. To obtain better memory-space utilization, you can use dynamic loading. With dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. All routines are kept on disk in a relocatable load format. The main program is loaded into memory and is executed. When a routine needs to call another routine; the calling routine first checks to see whether the other routine has been loaded. If not, the relocatable linking loader is called to load the desired routine into memory and to update the program's address tables to reflect this change. Then control is passed to the newly loaded routine. The advantage of dynamic loading is that an unused routine is never loaded. Dynamic loading does not require special support from the operating system. It is the responsibility of the users to design their programs to take advantage of such a method. Operating systems may help the programmer, however, by providing library routines to implement dynamic loading.
