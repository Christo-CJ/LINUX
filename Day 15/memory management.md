# Memory Management

The main purpose of a computer system is to execute programs. The program should be in primary memory to get executed. To improve both the utilization of the CPU and the speed of its response to users, the computer must keep several processes in main memory. The main motivation for management of main memory comes from the support for multiprogramming. Several executables processes reside in main memory at any given time. In other words, there are several programs using the main memory as their address space. Also, programs move into, and out of, the main memory as they terminate, or get suspended for some-IQ, or new executables are required to be loaded in main memory. So, the OS has to have some strategy for main memory management. Many memory-management schemes exist, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation. Selection of a memory-management scheme for a system depends on many factors, especially on the hardware design of the system. Each algorithm requires its own hardware support.

Also, a user requires revisiting his programs often during its evolution/However, due to the fact that primary memory is volatile, a user needs to store his program in some non-volatile store. All computers provide a non-volatile secondary memory available as an online storage. Programs and files may be disk resident and downloaded whenever their execution is required. Therefore. some form of memory management is needed at both primary and secondary memory levels. Secondary memory may store program script executable process images aped data files It may store applications, as well as, system programs. In fact, a good part of all OS, the system programs which provide services (the utilities for instance) are stored in the secondary memory. These are requisitioned as needed.
